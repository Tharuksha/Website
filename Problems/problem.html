    <h2 id="text">Water is essential to life. It need not be spelt out exactly how important it is. Yet water pollution is one of the most serious ecological threats we face today.</h3>
        <div id="header1">
            <h2>What is Water Pollution?</h2>
            <p>Toxic compounds enter water bodies such as lakes, rivers, and seas, where they are dissolved, suspended in the water, or deposit on the bed, resulting in water pollution. Water quality suffers as a result of this. Not only would this be disastrous
                for aquatic ecosystems, but the contaminants will also seep through and reach groundwater, potentially contaminating the water we use in our daily activities, including drinking.

                <h2>Causes of Water Pollution?</h2>
                <p>Water pollution can occur in a variety of ways, with city sewage and industrial waste discharge being one of the most harmful. Contaminants that reach the water supply through soils or groundwater systems, as well as rain, are examples
                    of indirect sources of water contamination. Human farming activities, as well as poorly disposed of industrial wastes, are found in soils and groundwaters.

                <h2>Sources of Water Pollution</h2>
                <p>
                    • Sewage (Waste Water) Sewage is another name for waste water from domestic and industrial processes. <br/><br/> • Agricultural Pollution. The agriculture industry covers 76% of the land area of England and Wales. <br/><br/> • Oil
                    Pollution. <br/><br/> • Radioactive Substances. <br/><br/> • River dumping. <br/><br/> • Marine Dumping.<br/><br/>

                <h2>Water Pollution Effects</h2>
                <p>
                    <h4>ON THE ENVIRONMENT</h4>
                    Water pollution truly harms biodiversity and aquatic ecosystems. The toxic chemicals can change the color of water and increase the amount of minerals - also known as eutrophication - which has a bad impact on life in water. Thermal pollution, defined
                    by a rise in the temperature of water bodies, contributes to global warming and causes serious hazard to water organisms.
                    <h4>ON HUMAN HEALTH</h4>
                    Water pollution has very negative effects on public health. A lot of diseases result from drinking or being in contact with contaminated water, such as diarrhea, cholera, typhoid, dysentery or skin infections. In zones where there is no available drinking
                    water, the main risk is dehydration obviously.

            <h2>What is Poor Sanitation?</h2>
            <p class="a">Poor sanitation is when people who live in a particular setting don't have access to safe water, good sewage system and live in a dirty environment. And more importantly lacks access to proper latrine.</p>
